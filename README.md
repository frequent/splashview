splashview
----------

**Cross browser/decive splash screen for desktop/mobile applications**

(Made during the late infancy of the mobile web)

Setting up an iOS splashscreen can be a real challenge both in terms
of number of images required, formatting and getting them to display
regularly in an HTML5 web-app. Plus you can only use them on iOS, 
while Android at the time of writing uses a Web Manifest and I'm 
certain there are yet more variants on how to display a loading 
screen on a specific OS/browser.

Splashview started over troubleshooting unstyled and blinking content 
which ended in covering the page and later removing it by hand once 
the application was running.

So away with browser vendors and staying with pure JS and CSS. Surely
not the last iteration but something to work with for the moment.
